# Pizzeria-Project
This was a project in my programming in java class at college. It simulates the checkout system of a pizzeria designed with multiple elements including scanners, strings, array lists, booleans, while loops, for loops, and if/else loop. There are a couple things I probably would've done differently (wording, functions, add-ons, getting rid of some things), but because there was a  rubric and auto-grader, I had to use the classes and functions my teacher wanted us to use. However, all the formatting and way I decided to code it was my choice and my style. Pizzeria class has my main/driver function.
