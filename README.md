# Pizzeria-Project
This was a project in my programming in java class at college. It imitates an ordering system for a pizzeria! There are a couple
things I probably would've done differently (wording, functions, add-ons, getting rid of some things), but because there was a 
rubric and auto-grader, I had to use the classes and functions my teacher wanted us to use. However, all the formatting and way
I decided to code it was my choice and my style.
